# Tripplo Dashboard Case Study

This is a Dashboard made in React for case study for Tripplo. This project forms part of their interview process.

Most of the components are hand made besides the Table and Dropdown components respectively. 
Since Only one page was required no routing is integrated in the app.

## Technologies used

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* TailwindCSS 
* PostCSS ()
* Styled-Components
* Bootstrap (for two components)
* CSS Grid
* Yarn



## Available Scripts


After cloning the repo and cd'ing into the project directory, you can run:

```
$ yarn install 
```
Which will install all the dependancies. 

Then you can run:

```
$ yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Things to consider:

* approah for different browsers
* advanced components
* how would this fit into the container/pages type pattern?
